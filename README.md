# Project Dacha #
## Project Dacha is singleplayer farming game with hard time-management and realistic growth system. Plants can become ill and you have to cure them or prevent infects beforehand.

### You (player) will be able to plant different cultures with their unique growth mechanics.
### Soil is changing according to the plants, that grow on it or when you use fertilizers. But they aren't applying instantly. You need to wait for some time. Did I mentioned, that some plants doesn't like different soils and fertilizers?
### Weather can be cruel. There is always a possibility for a full-rain week or something even worse. But you can help plants recover or protect them!
### Time is unstoppable. Yes, time doesn't change when you just walk around, only if you do some actions. But you won't be able to stay with your farm everyday. Only one day per week, only from april until late october...
### Plants are different too, some don't require anything (mostly), some need your attention, some won't even grow without your help.
### Game inherits real-life instruments and their real usage in our world!
### Deceases are different. Some are actual illnesses, some are just insects. But all of them have different yet same symptoms. Will you recognize one and defeat instantly or your plants will meet their doom?
